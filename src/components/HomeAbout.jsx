                        I always felt that I would like to do something different, and then I discovered programming and that's what I would like to do.
                        In September 2019 I started JavaScript Developer: React intensive course organized by Coders Lab in Pozna≈Ñ, 
                        Poland, where I studied programming intensively.  </p>

                        <p className="about-text">Now I am coding every day and I am looking for my first job as a Junior FrontEnd Developer. 
                        I am still working on my portfolio to present my skills from the best side.
                        Every day I learn a lot of new things that motivate me to keep going.
                        I am actively looking for a job and I believe that I will start a new job soon.

                        but I know that when I take up my first job I will give it 100%.
                        I believe that as a junior fronend developer I will have many development opportunities.
